In high school, I was very outgoing and involved in different clubs and organizations which was difficult for me when I entered college. I decided that it was time for me to join an organization and get more involved on campus. I had heard wonderful things about CA and at the time, my cousin was an incoming freshman and interested in the school's dance teams so I told her to check out CADC. We decided to come out to orientation to see what CA was all about and ended up joining. Little did I know how much I would come to love the organization and the people in it.</p> <p class=question>Why did you join board?</p> <p class=answer>Last year's board did such an amazing job of creating a fun and welcoming atmosphere for general members that within just a couple months, I knew I had made the right decision in joining CA out of all the many many others organizations on campus. I immediately wanted to get more involved in any way I could. I love and thrive on having responsibilities and being involved. Witnessing all the great interactions, experiences, and relationships that are made in CA solidified my resolve to join CA board. I am so grateful that I get to help create the same wonderful experience I received as a general member with new CA members. Working with such a great team ain't so bad either.</p> <p class=question>What are your hobbies?</p> <p class=answer>I love reading sci-fi fantasy and dystopian books! I was in choir for 7 years of my life so I looove singing. I also love dancing even if I'm not the best. I'm really into cooking and baking...and food in general. Who doesn't love food? If I have free time, you'll probably catch me on my laptop watching twitch streams or acapella competitions.</p> <p class=question>Favorite music genre and artists?</p> <p class=answer>I can pretty much listen to anything, but I love kpop(YG stan!) and Korean indie. For American music, I currently love BÃ˜RNS! Don't be surprised if you catch me listening to 1930-1950's vocal jazz (my fav) or 1960's rock. Turnt music (you know... a lil trap for the soul) is alwaaays welcome too! Music is a universal language so I don't discriminate too much. It's all good!</p> <p class=question>What is your favorite CA event?</p> <p class=answer>There are so many fun and exciting CA events that I had the pleasure of taking part in. The first event I attended where I really made connections with other members was Karaoke Night. It's wonderful letting your stress out with a bit of singing while making so many new friends. I also love family reveal night because it is so exciting to know who your big is and who else will be a part of your family. It's a great initial experience that opens up for further bonding and family fun throughout the year.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite annual event?</p> <p class=answer> I love Chinese Heritage Festival where we get to go and have a field day with all of our sister organizations. It helps build a stronger relationship within our organization while also meeting new people and making new friendships with people from other schools. It is loads of fun!</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite memory from Ski Trip?</p> <p class=answer>My favorite memory during last year's ski trip was pulling an all nighter with a few others to play poker non stop the night before leaving. It was crazy. Honestly, some of the best memories from ski trip are when we would just sit around and have really interesting conversations. You get to know so much about people you never knew you would even talk to. Some of the best friendships in CA are built during ski trip and it's overall an experience members cannot miss out on.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</p> <p class=answer>My favorite part of Culture Night is getting to see all the non stop hard work we have been putting in come to fruition. The night of Culture Night and the weeks leading up to it are crazy, but it is so rewarding when you get to see the end product which is a spectacular show put on through everyone's collaborative efforts. Last year I was a ninja and helped out with making props for skit which was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, due to my schedule, I wasn't able to help out on stage on the night of the show. This year, I really aim to get more involved and dedicate more of my time to making sure the show runs smoothly and at its best!</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer id=footer></footer> </div> <script type=text/javascript src=imports/content.js></script> </body> </html>
