We were actually catching up because I haven't seen or talked to him for about two years. When I swiped Elliot into the dining hall, he put on his secretary face and recruited me. A lot of my other friends were also in CA, so I thought why not join and see what the organization has to offer me. I decided to stay because I met a lot of different people and developed close friendships.</p><p class="question">Why did you join board?</p><p class="answer">In my first year of CA, I participated in intramural sports and our team actually didn't have an acting sports coord at the time. I felt that the members deserved to be taken care of. I joined board not only for that reason but also because I wanted to be more involved with our club. I enjoy sports related things, and I appreciate the values that CA integrates into our meetings and events. In CA, I experienced a lot of excitement and greatness; I simply want to be able to provide other members these priceless experiences.</p><p class="question">What are your hobbies?</p><p class="answer">Volleyball, running, ice cream tasting, making taco runs down the street, and playing ukulele</p><p class="question">Favorite music genre and artists?</p><p class="answer">I listen to a lot of different genres, but some of my favorites are R&B n Soul and Electronic.

One event that I like to look back at is Round 1. It was a simple and casual night out. Everyone was really free spirited. I had a great time socializing with other members.</p><p class="question">What's your favorite annual event?</p><p class="answer">One of my fav annual events was definitely Culture Night. Everybody was tired and running on little sleep, but we were all so proud, ready, and excited to display our progress from the past couple months. By the end of the night, we all felt accomplished; our hard work paid off. Aside from the work load, it was awesome seeing friends and family support us and other cultural performers take the stage. Overall, Culture Night is a night to remember.</p><p class="question">What's your favorite memory from Ski Trip?</p><p class="answer">One of my favorite memories from ski trip is the process of coming up with a skit with my group. We got close and comfortable pretty quickly and had a blast putting our scenes together. Every time we got together, a lot of humor and good vibes circulated the room. I really liked that feeling.</p><p class="question">What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</p><p class="answer">Last year, I participated in Culture Night as a ninja.
