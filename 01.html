I decided to be placed in a random family instead of joining their family, and in the end that made an enormous difference. I met so many different people and it really drove me to get to know everyone!</p><p class="question">Why did you join board?</p><p class="answer">I joined board because I knew I could benefit the team and act as an influential figure for the organization. Leadership is a quality that you cannot improve on without being exposed to it, and I knew this was (as cliche as it sounds) a once in a lifetime opportunity. I have to thank my OG big Jason for encouraging me to get more involved after my first year!</p><p class="question">What are your hobbies?</p><p class="answer">Drawing, food runs with friends, sniffing perfume samples from magazines</p><p class="question">Favorite music genre and artists?</p><p class="answer">Snakehips, Chainsmokers, Galantis, Jai Wolf, Marshmello</p><p class="question">What is your favorite CA event?</p><p class="answer">There are so many to choose from -- but by far Ski Trip was unforgettable. I (finally) learned to snowboard and made slushies from freshly fallen snow. It was insanely fun. Don't miss out on it!</p><p class="question">What's your favorite annual event and why?</p><p class="answer">Car Rally. It's held Week 1 of Fall quarter and it's an event when I meet the most amount of people in CA. I love being in the middle of the chaotic environment with so many new faces. I look forward to meeting anyone who is new to the club, so don't hesitate to approach me!</p><p class="question">What's your favorite memory from Ski Trip?</p><p class="answer">Stepping foot onto the Lake Tahoe pier. It was just so peaceful standing there in silence and looking toward the frozen horizon.</p><p class="question">What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</p><p class="answer">Last year I was the stage manager in charge of the "Ninjas," or the stage crew. Seeing them stepping out onto the stage to transition the scenes and moving props the day of the performance was my proudest moment of Culture Night. No one tripped!</p><p class="question">What's your favorite pun??</p><p class="answer">Why is it bad to eat too many gummy bears? Because you'd feel Haribo. AYYYYYY</p></div></div></div><footer id="footer"></footer></div><script type="text/javascript" src="imports/content.js"></script></body></html>
