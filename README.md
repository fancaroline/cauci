# CAUCI.com
Website for Chinese Association at the University of California, Irvine (Nov 2014 - Sept 2017)

In fall of 2015, I volunteered to construct a new website for CAUCI as a personal project.

The focus of this project was to design and construct a mobile-first, responsive website that utilized a clean, minimalist design. The clients requested that emphasis be placed on their photography as well as to provide succinct yet informative content to appeal to new or potential members of the organization. With the exception of the board member Q&A, all written content is my work.

During the design phase I maintained frequent communication with the clients to develop content that tailored to their needs. After release, I updated the website as needed to ensure the content remained relevant to visitors.

The website was formally released to the public in January 2015.

In September 2017, I relinquished the project to the new webmaster and allowed them to continue using my content and styling. Please note that I no longer maintain the current CAUCI.com.

Languages/Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Foundation 5
