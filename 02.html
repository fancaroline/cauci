I stayed because CA became my home away from home. You really can't find more openminded, friendly people.</p> <p class=question>Why did you join board?</p> <p class=answer>Originally I came in as an intern. From there I ran for fundraising chair and now I'm back as the IVP. What can I say? I really like Chinese Association and I want to see it grow. The best way to do that is to join board. So, here I am, again.</p> <p class=question>What are your hobbies?</p> <p class=answer>I'm really, really into musicals. I've seen Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, Mamma Mia, and of course HAMILTON. My next show is Waitress! I just love watching people perform on stage. Outside of that, I'm also an avid dancer and sneakerhead. Also enjoy photography, Netflix marathons, and woodcarving!</p> <p class=question>Favorite music genre and artists?</p> <p class=answer>EDM (Progressive House, House): Elephante, Marshmello, Vicetone, Galantis, EDEN</p> <p class=question>What is your favorite CA event?</p> <p class=answer>One (new!) event that I really liked last year was Starry Night. We hiked to the top of Turtle Rock in the dark with a bunch of lit up balloons (lanterns!) and it was absolutely magical. I was so scared of getting blown off the hill or tripping but that kind of made it more exciting.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite annual event?</p> <p class=answer>Culture Night! It's great to finally see all the hard work that we've put in over the year finally pay off. Not to mention the crazy actor's high that gets everyone super into their roles. This year I'm joining skit again and helping out with stage direction!</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite memory from Ski Trip?</p> <p class=answer>My favorite part of the trip were the skits that each group had to come up with. It was so much fun playing out all the inside jokes we've made over the course of the week.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</p> <p class=answer>Last year, I was a part of skit as a supporting actress. I also doubled working in preparing the costumes. I think the best part about Culture Night is knowing the scope of the performance and seeing it all come together. The day of Culture Night, everyone comes together to focus on making the show as great as they can. That's an amazingly empowering part of the whole experience.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite pun??</p> <p class=answer>Whiteboards are remarkable :D</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer id=footer></footer> </div> <script type=text/javascript src=imports/content.js></script> </body> </html>
