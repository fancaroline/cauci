I wanted to try to get out of my comfort zone, therefore, I joined Chinese Association in hopes of being able to open up. Now, I stay in CA because of all the cool people that I have met and helped me grow. And as testament to how much I've changed... nowadays when I tell people how I was like in high school they don't believe me. :P</p> <p class=question>Why did you join board?</p> <p class=answer>I created many fun memories in CA. They became a second family to me and to repay them for all the great times, and I wanted to help spread the fun and to share my experience with others. Last year was so rewarding I decided to go for another year!</p> <p class=question>What are your hobbies?</p> <p class=answer>I love drawing and graphic design, reading novels or manga, playing badminton, and surfing. I'm also a fan of beach hikes near cliffsides or tidepools.</p> <p class=question>Favorite music genre and artists?</p> <p class=answer>I enjoy listening to EDM, Kpop, and anything upbeat. Heading to EDC and Coachella next year!</p> <p class=question>What is your favorite CA event?</p> <p class=answer>Broomball, roller blading, and laser tag are my favorites. Pretty much anything that's active and competitive.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite annual event?</p> <p class=answer>CAUCI's Constituent Event is really fun. I love that each member gets paired with another constituent either from CADC or CAMA. It's a great way to meet everyone who's involved in the club, whether they're here for martial arts, dance, or just to socialize.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite memory from Ski Trip?</p> <p class=answer>Everything we do during ski trip is an awesome experience, but if I were to choose, it would be the moment before everyone is about to sleep. It's the moment we start having these deep conversations about the things we like or the weird experiences we've had. We become so much closer friends.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</p> <p class=answer>I joined CA's traditional Chinese dance team for the last 2 years. My best memory was performing on stage. The rush and the feeling of accomplishment that I get while staring into the audience was amazing. I would probably continue with traditional Chinese dance because it's something I wouldn't be able to do anywhere else.</p> <p class=question>What's your favorite pun??</p> <p class=answer>I'd tell you a chemistry joke but I know I wouldn't get a reaction.</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer id=footer></footer> </div> <script type=text/javascript src=imports/content.js></script> </body> </html>
