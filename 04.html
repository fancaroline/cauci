I felt like I needed to get involved to find my home away from home and CA did just that :) ! Not only was I able to make new friends (who have become my best friends in college), but I also gained new leadership experience, explored new places, and created memories that I'll never forget!</p><p class="question">Why did you join board?</p><p class="answer">Since my freshman year, I've been a part of CA and this organization has definitely become a part of my favorite college experiences. It's an organization that helped get me through the past three years, and I wanted to end my college career by being a part of board. One of the plus sides of joining board is that I get to work with all of the friends I have met throughout the years.</p><p class="question">What are your hobbies?</p><p class="answer">I'm typically a very lazy person! I love just chilling at home and watching YouTube, random movies, TV shows (Friends, Full House, White Collar), and Kdramas :D But besides the typical lazy life, I actually love going on mini adventures! I love visiting new places and eating at new food places whenever I get the chance! If you know a new food/drink (coffee/boba) place, a nice beach, a place with a nice view, or a chill hike, then I'd totally be up for it. But most of all, I was born and raised as a huuuuuge DISNEY fan. If you have an annual pass, then hit me up cause I'd totally be down to go to Disneyland with you! On my down time, I also really enjoy baking and doing arts/crafts, like pottery and such! There's much more to know about me, so just hit me up and I'd love to chat with you!</p><p class="question">Favorite music genre and artists?</p><p class="answer">I have a very large range of music I listen to - R&B, K-Pop, Hip-Hop, Pop, Rap, EDM, Youtube Covers, etc. - LOL you name it and I'll probably be able to find a song on my phone for you.</p><p class="question">What is your favorite CA event?</p><p class="answer">One of my favorite CA events would definitely be Car Rally! Although Car Rally is set up to be a typical scavenger hunt, I find that it is a great way for new members to mingle with new people. Since meeting a large group of people at once can be a bit intimidating, I feel like Car Rally allows new members to meet a few people at a time while also competing with other fellow members. I also love any events with our BIG 5 schools (UCSD, UCR, USC, UCLA). wootwoot!</p><p class="question">What's your favorite annual event?</p><p class="answer">My favorite annual event would definitely be our annual Ski Trip. It may be a long trip, but it's definitely worth all the memories you gain! It's a new experience that fulfills basically every college student's "dream" to go on a vacation with all of their friends. Even if you don't know everyone going on the trip, you'll definitely get to know them SUPER well by the end. There are way too many reasons why this event is so great, and the only way to find out is if you GO!</p><p class="question">What's your favorite memory(s) from Ski Trip?</p><p class="answer">I learned how not to fall on my face while skiing!</p><p class="question">What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</p><p class="answer">Since I've joined CA, I've been able to be a part of their annual Culture Night! It is honestly an amazing experience that is indescribable unless you've experienced it yourself. In the past, I helped do lighting for the show and I also helped take photos while sitting in the audience. I've been able to experience what it's like actually putting the show together and also as an audience member. If you're curious about the show, then GET INVOLVED!</p><p class="question">What's your favorite pun??</p><p class="answer">What did the fish say when it swam into the wall? DAM!</p></div></div></div><footer id="footer"></footer></div><script type="text/javascript" src="imports/content.js"></script></body></html>
