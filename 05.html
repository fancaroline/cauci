So when my second year rolled around I jumped at the opportunity to get involved. Boyyy has life changed since then.</p> <p class=question>Why did you join board?</p> <p class=answer>As a CA member and intern during the 2014-2015 school year, I realized how much time I committed to CA and it was because I loved the organization so much. I absolutely regretted not joining the year after because I thought I would be too busy. This time I decided to go for it and there hasn't been a moment where I regretted it.</p> <p class=question>What are your hobbies?</p> <p class=answer>I am a huge foodie that loves trying new restaurants, and I especially love trying new boba places! On my free time I usually watch Korean variety shows (who watches Superman is Back??) or Kdramas. I also like going to Disneyland every once in a while. Hello, lobster nachos.</p> <p class=question>Favorite music genre and artists?</p> <p class=answer>I'm very open to a lot of different music genres and artists since I'm not a huge music person. I like getting exposed to different music from a lot of people so that I can enjoy what they like with them. I used to have a huge KPOP phase from middle school to high school so for that, my favorite artists would be SNSD and EXO. I've recently started listening to EDM and I've been liking Porter, Martin Garrix, Audien, and Seven Lions!</p> <p class=question>What is your favorite CA event?</p> <p class=answer>I always enjoy going roller skating, idk why. I'm not the greatest at roller skating but the chill vibes of the whole rink with the music and lights make it really fun and different than a lot of things I usually do. Shoutout to Anna for playing her music this past roller skating after event; it was so good! </p> <p class=question>What's your favorite annual event?</p> <p class=answer>SKI TRIP. GO if you can! It's one of the biggest events that CA holds per year and you don't want to miss out. We go during winter break and people still don't know each other that well in the club but after ski trip you make so many memories and bonds with people that you wouldn't have if you didn't go. Don't miss out on me falling on my butt a bajillion times while snowboarding :D </p> <p class=question>What's your favorite memory from Ski Trip?</p> <p class=answer>The long nights staying up with people you enjoy spending time with <3 </p> <p class=question>What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</p> <p class=answer>Culture Night is my other favorite annual event and I participated as a dancer for both years I was in CA (last year I was the All Girls Dance Coord). I love this event because for one night we are able to put on a production that we worked all year for and it's so rewarding to be on stage with your team and your fellow CA members. We all work towards CACN separately in our own groups but for a week we bring it all together to make something magical. I would love to be a dancer again this year but I might try to do something else like ninja since it's my last year in college. I HIGHLY encourage everyone to be a part of CACN if you have the chance to experience this magic yourselves :) </p> <p class=question>What's your favorite pun??</p> <p class=answer>When I went to Honeymee recently with my big, I took a snapchat of my ice cream and captioned it "hanging out with my bee-ggie." GET IT???? Lawl I thought I was so clever. SHOUTOUT TO EDDIE FOR BEING THE BEST bee-ggie hehe. </p> </div> </div> </div> <footer id=footer></footer> </div> <script type=text/javascript src=imports/content.js></script> </body> </html>
